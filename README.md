Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that's used very
frequently in computer vision and machine learning. When we deal with features with large
dimensionalities, training a machine learning system becomes prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we
need to reduce the dimensionality of the data before we can train a system. However, when we reduce
the dimensionality, we don't want to lose the information present in the data. This is where PCA comes
into the picture! PCA identifies the important components of the data and arranges them in the order of
importance.
